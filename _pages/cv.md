Projects
======
Exoplanet Research around Evolved Binary Star Systems (Apr 2023 – Apr 2026)
* The project focuses on investigating exoplanets around evolved binary star systems, particularly those in the common-
envelope phase, by utilizing photometric observations and the Eclipse Timing Variation (ETV) method. As part of the
research, I conducted detailed photometric observations using 80-cm telescope (T80) in Kreiken Observatory and 100-
cm telescope (T100) in TÜBİTAK National Observatory and analyzed the resulting light curves to study the dynamics
of these systems. Additionally, I explored the physical properties of the binaries to understand potential mechanisms
behind second-generation planet formation.
TÜBİTAK Project No: 122F358, TÜBİTAK T100 Project No: 2049, Project Instructor: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Özgür Baştürk

Transit Timing Variations Analyses of Orbital Decay Candidate Objects (Apr 2023 – Feb 2026)
* As an active researcher and observer in this project, I focused on investigating hot-Jupiters exhibiting orbital decay
behavior through Transit Timing Variations (TTV) analysis, aiming to understand the tidal mechanisms driving these
phenomena. I designed and executed observation plans, conducted photometric observations using the 80-cm (T80)
and 100-cm (T100) telescopes, and processed the data to identify potential orbital decay candidates. Utilizing Python
and advanced statistical methods, I performed detailed TTV analyses and interpreted the results in the context of
magnetohydrodynamics, fluid dynamics, and orbital mechanics. The findings are planned to be shared through
publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conferences.
