Welcome! I’m Ahmet Cem, a PhD student in astrophysics and lifelong learner.
This site brings together my academic work, thoughts on astronomy & astrophysics, and personal interests—from cinema to cue sports.
You’ll find tutorials, codes, blog posts, and reflections from both the scientific skies and everyday life. 

Academic background
======
I am currently a PhD student at the Astrophysics Centre of Keele University, working in collaboration with the [PLATO Multiple Stars Working Group (MSWG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07994). My research focuses on binary star systems within the context of upcoming space missions and stellar evolution.

Previously, I completed my MSc in Astronomy and Space Sciences at Ankara University. My thesis, titled "Investigating Orbital Decay in Selected Hot Jupiters", involved transit timing analysis to study orbital period variations in close-in gas giants.

I hold a BSc degree in Physics from Middle East Technical University (METU), where I built a solid foundation in both theoretical and observational astrophysics.

My research interests include exoplanets, binary stars, star–planet interactions, and observational techniques such as photometry and spectroscopy.

For more information, you can view my [CV](/cv).

What I'm working on
------
I am currently working on the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of eclipsing binary stars as part of the PLATO Multiple Stars Working Group (MSWG). My main focus is the characterization of detached binary systems, which serve as valuable benchmarks for stellar evolution studies.

Alongside this, I am exploring machine learning applications for the classification of binary stars, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of large-scale surveys.

Building on my previous work on orbital decay in hot Jupiter systems, I also maintain a strong interest in exoplanet characterization and star–planet interactions. My earlier research, based on transit timing variations (TTVs), continues to shape the way I approach close-in planetary systems and their long-term dynamical behavior.

Solar System: An album describing our home and neighborhood
------
Upon concluding my MSc studies, I joined forces with my dear friends Türker Bakış (Baeron) and Berkay Altan (Völva) to create an album that translates the spirit of our Solar System into music.

Each piece captures the essence and emotions inspired by the major celestial bodies that surround us.

Discover the sounds of our cosmic neighborhood by listening to the album on Spotify below.
